**Documentation**

- Keep `README.md` concise and high-level; the bar needs to be extremely high for what shows up there.
- Most documentation lives in `docs/`, the published docs site.
- One owner per fact: `docs/src/content/docs/reference/global-config.md` and `docs/src/content/docs/reference/repo-config.md` own configuration keys, `docs/src/content/docs/reference/environment.md` owns environment variables and the telemetry local/remote split, `docs/src/content/docs/concepts/daemon.md` owns the daemon lifecycle model, and guides pages explain purpose and link to those owners instead of restating tables and examples.
- The `document.instructions` block in `.no-mistakes.yaml` states this ownership map for the pipeline's document step; update it when ownership moves.

**Agent-Guidance Surfaces**

- The files under `skills/no-mistakes/` are **generated**: the source of truth is `internal/skill/skill.go` (the `body` constant for `SKILL.md`, plus one constant per disclosed reference file returned by `Files()`). Edit those constants, then `make skill`; `make lint` fails CI on drift of any of them. Never edit the generated files directly. `no-mistakes init` ships the whole set to agents at user level. `SKILL.md` carries what every invocation needs; reference material only some runs reach is disclosed to a sibling file it points at by relative path. `skill.Bundle()` is the guidance-sync surface, so a canonical pinned sentence may live in either.
- Agent-driving guidance is owned by the skill body and the live `axi` output strings (`internal/cli/axi*.go`); `docs/src/content/docs/guides/agents.md` carries only the canonical invariant sentences pinned by `internal/cli/axi_guidance_test.go` plus a pointer to the skill. When you change driving guidance, change the skill body and the point-of-use `axi` strings together; that drift test is the sync check.
- The shared default test-quality rule lives in `internal/testguidance`; render it only into the task-first skill and pipeline roles that can author, repair, or review tests. Its fake-agent prompt tests are the intentional generated-interface contract, not source-text checks.
- Review auto-fix is disabled by default (`auto_fix.review: 0` in `config.go` `autoFixDefaults`), so blocking and ask-user review findings park for an agent decision; keep the skill, the live `axi` gate `note`, and docs qualified if you touch review auto-fix.
