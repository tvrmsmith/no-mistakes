**macOS Release Signing (permanent identity)**

- Every official macOS release artifact - both `darwin/arm64` and `darwin/amd64` - is Developer ID Application signed on a macOS runner with a fixed identifier, hardened runtime, secure timestamp, and no entitlements, then strictly verified before it is archived or checksummed; the Linux and Windows release paths are unchanged.
- The executable identifier `com.kunchenguid.no-mistakes` and Team ID `9T2J7MNUP9` are the permanent Developer ID identity and MUST NEVER change: they are the invariant of the identity-based designated requirement that lets macOS permission grants survive `no-mistakes update`, so changing either resets every grant once.
- Signing runs only in the darwin build job gated behind the `release-signing` GitHub environment; the certificate is the base64 `CSC_LINK` secret unlocked with `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, imported into an ephemeral keychain with a runtime-generated password that is deleted on success and failure, and no other job may reference those secrets.
- Signing happens before tarball creation and checksum generation, and the verify gate fails the release closed on any missing or ambiguous signature, wrong Team ID, non-permanent identifier, content-based (`cdhash`) requirement, missing hardened runtime or timestamp, or wrong architecture.
- Mechanics live in `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the contract is pinned by the root `TestReleaseWorkflow*` static tests in `workflow_release_signing_test.go`, and secret values are never recorded here or in any test fixture.
- Notarization, stapling, a PKG, Homebrew, and universal binaries are intentionally out of scope for this phase.
