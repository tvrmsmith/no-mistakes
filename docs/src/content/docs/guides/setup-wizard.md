title: Setup Wizard
description: What bare `no-mistakes` does when there's no active run on the current branch.
---

When you run `no-mistakes` with no arguments and there is no active run on the
current branch, `no-mistakes` can walk you through creating a branch,
committing local changes, and pushing through the gate, then attach if the
daemon registers the new run. This is the setup wizard.

The point of the wizard is to make bare `no-mistakes` a useful starting
command, not just an attach command. If you have local work but no run yet, the
wizard helps turn that state into branch -> commit -> push -> attach when the
daemon registers the new run.

The wizard kicks in when:

- You're in an interactive terminal, or you passed `no-mistakes -y` / `no-mistakes --yes`.
- The gate is initialized for the current repo (`no-mistakes init` has been run).
- There's no active run on the current branch.

In non-interactive contexts, bare `no-mistakes` without `-y` falls back to listing the last 5 runs instead.

With `-y` / `--yes`, the wizard takes the default automated path for each step: use agent suggestions for branch and commit when needed, then push to the gate. In a TTY, that path stays visible and auto-advances through the wizard. Without a TTY, it falls back to the headless path.

Pass `--skip` to skip comma-separated pipeline steps for the new run created by the wizard, for example `no-mistakes --skip test,lint`.
It only applies when the wizard starts a new pipeline run; if bare `no-mistakes` attaches to an active run or lists recent runs, `--skip` exits with an error.

If you want to attach to *any* active run in the repo (not just the current branch), use `no-mistakes attach` - that path skips the wizard entirely.

```

## Steps

The interactive wizard is a full-screen flow that runs only the steps your current repo state needs, up to three total. The `-y` / `--yes` path runs the same steps and accepts the automated default at each one. In a TTY, the TUI stays visible and auto-advances. Without a TTY, it runs headlessly.

While the wizard is running, it also updates your terminal window title with the current setup step and branch. On exit or cancel, it clears that temporary title.

### 1. Branch

Shown when you're on the default branch or a detached `HEAD`. Prompts for a branch name.

- Type a name to create a new branch.
- Leave blank and press enter to ask the configured agent for a branch name suggestion based on your local changes.
- Press `q` to quit.

### 2. Commit

Shown when you have uncommitted changes. Prompts for a commit message.

- Type a message to commit all changes.
- Leave blank and press enter to ask the configured agent for a commit subject suggestion based on the diff.

### 3. Push

Always shown. Asks whether to push the current branch to the `no-mistakes` gate.

- Press `y` to push.
- Press `n` to stop.

If the push succeeds, the interactive wizard stays visible in a brief `waiting for run…` state while the daemon registers the new run, then hands off to the main TUI and attaches. If no run appears in time, the wizard exits with an error instead of silently falling through, and points you at the gate's `notify-push.log` for hook diagnostics.

The goal is to keep the setup path short. If you already have a branch, it does
not ask for one. If everything is already committed, it skips straight to push.

## Retry on failure

If any step fails (git error, agent error, network error), the interactive wizard shows the error and lets you press `r` to retry the step without restarting the whole flow.

With `-y` / `--yes`, the wizard exits on the first error instead of prompting to retry, whether it is auto-advancing in a TTY or running headlessly.

## Quitting safely

Press `q` to quit.

If the wizard has already created a branch or commit on your behalf, quitting requires pressing `q` twice. The first press shows a confirmation warning so you don't accidentally leave those side effects behind. The second press exits.

That double-confirm is intentional. The wizard is allowed to make real Git side
effects, so exiting should not be too easy once those side effects exist.

## Agent suggestions

When you leave branch name or commit subject blank, the wizard invokes the configured agent (global or per-repo `agent` setting, including fallback lists) to produce a suggestion. The agent sees the local diff and returns:

- A kebab-case branch name prefixed with a type (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, etc.)
- A conventional-commit subject line, using `feat` or `fix` for user-facing product impact so release automation can pick it up

The managed agent server (Rovo Dev or OpenCode) writes its output to `~/.no-mistakes/logs/wizard-agent.log` during these runs.

## Environment sanity

The wizard requires:

- The gate to be initialized (`no-mistakes init` has run).
- A clean enough state to commit and push.
- A configured native or ACP agent, only when the wizard needs to suggest a branch name or commit subject. For an ordered fallback list, at least one configured entry must be available. See the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent) for ACP aliases and target requirements.
  If you already have a branch and clean working tree, or you enter those values yourself in the interactive flow, the wizard can continue without agent suggestions.

If any of those are missing, the wizard reports the problem and exits.
`no-mistakes doctor` is the fastest way to check whether the configured global runner can start a validation gate.
The wizard can proceed without an agent when it does not need a suggestion, but the pushed validation gate still fails before its first step unless the effective pipeline-agent configuration resolves to a runnable runner.
