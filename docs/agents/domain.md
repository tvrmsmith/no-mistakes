# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This repo is **single-context**: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root: the glossary of domain terms.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

`AGENTS.md` is a separate surface and stays authoritative for behavior and traps. `CONTEXT.md` defines vocabulary; `AGENTS.md` records what the code does. Keep a fact in one of them, not both.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-cheap-gates-before-review-and-restart-on-agent-commits.md
├── cmd/no-mistakes/
└── internal/
```

If this ever grows into a multi-package repo, the multi-context layout is a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context, with context-scoped ADRs under each context's own `docs/adr/`.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:
